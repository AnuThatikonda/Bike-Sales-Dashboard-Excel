# Bike Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and visualizing bike sales data using Excel. The objective was to create a clean dataset, perform data analysis, and design an insightful dashboard for bike sales performance.

## Data Cleaning

1. **Removed Duplicates**: Identified and removed 26 duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
2. **Fixed Marital Status and Gender**: Standardized the 'Marital Status' and 'Gender' columns to avoid confusion caused by the use of only the first letter.
3. **Currency Formatting**: Removed decimals from the currency column for cleaner presentation.
4. **Age Bracket Column**: Added a new column to categorize individuals into age brackets, improving the clarity and usability of the data in the dashboard.

## Pivot Table

Created multiple **Pivot Tables** to summarize and analyze key bike sales data points. These tables serve as the foundation for visual insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

## Dashboard

Designed a **Bike Sales Dashboard** using the pivot table visualizations. The dashboard presents a clear and interactive summary of key sales metrics, allowing for an easy understanding of bike sales trends across various parameters.
